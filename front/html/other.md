### Simple structure of a website
* Header: <header>
* Navigation Bar: <nav>
* Main Content: <main>, which is subsectioned by <article>, <section>, and <div>.
* Side bar: <aside>, often placed in side main content.
* Footer: <footer>

### Video content
For some fallback video options for the browser may not support, here is an example with full features:
<video
  controls width="400" height="400" autoplay loop muted preload="auto" poster="poster.png"
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
